Open the file named as 'group_7_finalproject.pde' and click on the 'Run' button. 

Once the window opens, click on the play button at the center of the screen to start the game.

Use left/right arrow or 'A'/'D' keys to move the sprite horizontally. 

To pause the game, press the pause button on the top right corner. And when you'd like to resume, clicked on it again.

To reset the game, click on the reset button (next to the pause button). 

Goal of this game: shoot the zombies as they come to the sprite and try to avoid them reaching the bottom of the screen. 
There's also a chance of Mac-10 guns dropping if you shoot a zombie and once you successfully collect the gun, the sprite
will experience a short period of power-up by firing up the bullets more quickly (by pressing 'E' after the power up is collected). 

Your score and lives are displayed on the top left corner of the screen. You lose when lives hit 0 and win when you successfully shoot all zombies
before they hit the bottom of the screen.
